## Implementation

### Technology:

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. 
Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.
